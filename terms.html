        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Nexnova Technologies is excited to offer our Referral Program, designed to reward our customers and partners
            for referring new clients to us. By participating in this program, you agree to comply with the following
            terms and conditions.</p>

        <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The Referral Program is open to all individuals who are at least 18 years old.</li>
            <li>You do not need to be a prior customer of Nexnova Technologies to participate.</li>
            <li>Employees of Nexnova Technologies and their immediate family members are not eligible.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How the Program Works</h2>
        <p>Refer a new client to Nexnova Technologies by sharing their contact details or having them mention your name
            during their inquiry. The referred client must engage Nexnova Technologies for services such as mobile app
            development, website creation, poster design, or other listed services. Upon successful completion of the
            referred clientâ€™s project and receipt of full payment, you will be rewarded based on the project value.</p>

        <h2>4. Reward Structure</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Small Websites (Basic Packages):</strong> Earn â‚¹500 per successful referral.</li>
            <li><strong>Custom Packages and Larger Projects:</strong> Rewards are determined based on the project value
                and scope.</li>
            <li>Payments will be made directly to your bank account or via other available payment methods.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Reward Process</h2>
        <p>After the referred client has completed their project and made full payment, Nexnova Technologies will verify
            the referral. Rewards will be processed within 15 business days of verification. For any disputes, proof of
            referral may be required (e.g., a forwarded email, screenshot of your referral communication, etc.).</p>

        <h2>6. General Terms</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Referrals must be new clients who have not previously worked with Nexnova Technologies.</li>
            <li>Multiple referrals for the same client will result in only one reward.</li>
            <li>Rewards are non-transferable and cannot be exchanged for any other goods or services.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Prohibited Conduct</h2>
        <p>Participants may not refer themselves or create fake referrals to earn rewards. Any fraudulent activity,
            including spamming or misuse of the program, will result in disqualification from the Referral Program.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes and Termination</h2>
        <p>Nexnova Technologies reserves the right to modify or terminate the Referral Program at any time without prior
            notice. If changes are made, participants will be notified through our website or via email.</p>
